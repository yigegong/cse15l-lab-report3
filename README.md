# Part1
We choose the bug in the method `reverseInPlace` in the java file ArrayExamples.

1. A failure-inducing input:
   ```
   @Test 
   public void testReverseInPlace() {
   	int[] input1 = { 1,2,3,4,5 };
   	ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
   	assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 5,4,3,2,1 }, input1);
	}  
   ```
   
  In this case, the failure inducing input is `input1={1,2,3,4,5}`
  
2. An input that doesn't induce a failure:
    ```
   @Test 
    public void testReverseInPlace2() {
    	int[] input1 = { 1 };
    	ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    	assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 1 }, input1);
	}
   ```
    
  In this case, `input1={1}` does not induce a failure.

3. The symptom:
   ![Image](1.jpg)

4. The bug:
   
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
     	arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```
    
   After it's fixed:
   
   ```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length/2; i += 1) {
      int temp = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = temp;
    }
  }
  ```

5. Briefly describe (2-3 sentences) why the fix addresses the issue.
The bug is this line: `arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1]`, which goes wrong for the iterations after arr.length/2 and copies the original elements back.



To fix this problem, we only iterate for half of the length, saving the element in the first half to `temp`, passing `arr[arr.length - i - 1]` to `arr[i]`, and passing the value of `arr[i]` to `arr[arr.length - i - 1]` through `temp`. By swaping values in pairs, we successfully reverse the array.
